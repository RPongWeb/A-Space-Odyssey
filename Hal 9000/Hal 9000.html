	<p class="one"> Personally, the movie started out a bit confusing in the beginning but then it quickly got onto the main part that introduced the characters and the main conflict of the movie. From there, the members of the ship, including Hal, were working well together for a few days and even playing games with one another and cooperating until accusations occured that led to the downfall of the mission's success.

		Overall, I think this movie was great, although the beginning and ending were a bit confusing but with a bit of thinking, it can all be resolved.The movie was way ahead of its time as the space scenes were shot well ahead of the 1960's technology and what suprised me the most was how the directors got the scene of Bowman talking to his daughter through some tablet. It's like they knew that this is what Skype or Facetime would be and that this technology would exist.<br /> Grade : 8.9 / 10
